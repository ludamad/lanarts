-- Do everything to make kiting in the overworld a bad idea
    -- Every time you kill something, spawn something just out of view, appropriate for the area the player is in
    -- Spawn fast things.
    -- Obsolete now that overworld is decidedly clearable?

-- smaller levels in last dungeon
    -- Maybe?
-- Never go bare fisted if have weapon!!
    - Go weapon if unequip arrows
    - mp/hp regen rings unpowered -- add buff + diff bonuses?

RANDART PROPERTIES:
    + attack vs clouds
    + regen while resting
    + speed while damaged
    + berserk duration

TODO:
    + Dance pants: Cursed, +1 speed, random walk on hit
    + Archer totem -- place totem, starting firing quickly towards it
    + Mage bomb -- place bomb, it explodes
    -- scale overworld to # players
    + send sync data for all objects in view by all players every frame
        + have players send their set of objects in view, if ever objects are communicated that dont exist, do level-wide sync
        + have different sync levels.
            sync level 1:
                no object communcation beyond player positions, level-wide sync if player positions dont match
            sync level 2:
                communicate object positions for any objects in view by any players on any persons copy, level-wide sync if mismatch
                -- Also communicate character health?
            sync level 3:
                communicate full data about any objects in view? level-wide sync on level enter?
    + have network communication during level loading?
        + Tricky AF, easiest to serialize any finalized levels.
        + Just have server generate all levels and lazily send? Long-term.
    + Lazy CSP?
        + Have server play normally, have clients play out of sync, use sync level 3
        + With a separated server, this could work!
            +Major problem tho is newly created instances. Need to have a translation layer to accomodate these instances somehow? Significant complexity.
    + turret enemy
    + Make sure all is_enemy stuff gets put into a proper API
Out there:
    Class that cannot do any damage, just takes damage and reciprocates it. 
    Focus on good health regen, heal spells, summons?
FOR MAGE/NECROMAGE?:
    + Slow down, do damage to all those around you, gain +2 magic / turn
    + FIX EFFECT CODE ALREADY

Necrotank:
    + Strong aspect of hurt back enemies / turn them into zombies
    spells: summon zombie / pain / grapple (hold everyone nearby, thresholding how much damage you can take per X steps, and damaging everyone over time)

Necromancer:
    + Make sure the melee build is no where near as viable as it currently is? Maybe. They cant do crowd control or hard mobs, anyway.
        + OK currently the regen provides them with wayy too much damage. TBH just ban them from using melee is fine.
            + Take away the whole equipment slot? Suddenly we'd have a game. They can do small amounts of melee damage with their damage-back ability.
            + Remove damage-back???? -- I like it, though. Maybe make it a long buff spell?
    => No strength anymore?

-- Randomly decide whether bosses have lanarts, include visual indicator that they do or dont
-- Poison everyone in LOS spell
-- Make enemy go mad, attacking anyone spell (Mage? Mage branch?)
--  
    -- Curse type: Lethargic. When this player CAN rest it MUST rest.
        - Deep sleep -- only wake on hit?
    Item traits:
        + Spawn enemies around you
            + only in big encounters
        + XP bonus on kill  
+ Move the dragon out of that dungeon?? -- behind skull door to dragon lair?
+ Make snakes/first dungeon give more XP? -- XP scroll?
