0. Start from readme.txt
1. How to build and run Oxygine on Windows with CMake and MINGW with CodeBlocks or CLion. Steps:
=================================================================================================
- Prepare SDL2 for building:
   	- open SDL\src\dynapi\SDL_dynapi.h and find these lines:

	    #ifdef SDL_DYNAMIC_API  /* Tried to force it on the command line? */
		#error Nope, you have to edit this file to force this off.
		#endif


	- add lines below:

		#if __MINGW32__
		#define SDL_DYNAMIC_API 0
		#endif

	- result:
    
	    #ifdef SDL_DYNAMIC_API  /* Tried to force it on the command line? */
		#error Nope, you have to edit this file to force this off.
		#endif

		#if __MINGW32__
		#define SDL_DYNAMIC_API 0
		#endif


- Build SDL2. Add these options to CMake command line:

    -DRENDER_D3D=0 -DVIDEO_OPENGLES=0


	example for codeblocks:
		
		cmake .. -G"CodeBlocks - MinGW Makefiles" -DRENDER_D3D=0 -DVIDEO_OPENGLES=0

	example for CLion:

	    - open SDL2 cmake project
	    - go to menu->File->Settings->Build,Execution,Deployment->
	    - and add  -DRENDER_D3D=0 -DVIDEO_OPENGLES=0  to  CMake options
	    - build...


- Find compiled libraries and dlls: libSDL2.dll, libSDL2.dll.a, libSDL2.a, libSDL2main.a
  and copy it to oxygine-framework\libs


2. now you are ready to open and build examples.
=================================================================================================
- select any example from examples folder. I chose Demo

- copy libSDL2.dll and dlls from oxygine-framework\oxygine\third_party\win32_mingw\dlls\ to data folder :
  oxygine-framework\examples\Demo\data\

CLion:

	- open Demo project in CLion: oxygine-framework/examples/Demo/proj.cmake/CMakeLists.txt
	- go to menu->Run->Edit Configurations
	- find Demo in the list of Apllications and set working directory to Demo "data" folder  (where you copied dlls)
	- menu->Run->Build and Run Demo application

CodeBlocks:

	- go to folder oxygine-framework/examples/Demo/proj.cmake/
	- create "build" folder inside
	- go to "build" folder:
	- run command:
		cmake .. -G"CodeBlocks - MinGW Makefiles"
	- open generated project Demo.cbp in CodeBlocks

	- menu->Build->select target->Demo
	- menu->Project->Properties->Build targets-> find target "Demo" and set Execution directory to Demo "data" folder  (where you copied dlls)
	- menu->Build->Build	
	- menu->Build->Run!
