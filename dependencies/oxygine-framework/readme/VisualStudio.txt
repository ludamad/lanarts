1. Start from readme.txt

If you are using the Oxygine All-In-One version with SDL included, you can skip #2
and just go to any example and open it right away

2. There are prebuilt example solutions for VS2010+
=================================================================================================
- Build SDL:
  - Open SDL\include\SDL_config_windows.h in any text editor
  - Find this line:
    #define SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER_XAUDIO2    1
  - and comment it so it looks like:
    //#define SDL_AUDIO_DRIVER_XAUDIO2    1
  - Go to folder SDL\VisualC\ 
  - Open SDL.sln and build it in Release configration
  - Go to folder SDL\VisualC\Win32\Release\
  - and copy SDL2.lib, SDL2main.lib and SDL2.dll to oxygine-framework/libs

- Go to oxygine-framework\examples and choose any example, for example "Demo"
- Open the solution located in oxygine-framework\examples\Demo\proj.win32\
- Try to build the Demo
- Copy all dlls from oxygine-framework\oxygine\third_party\win32\dlls\
   and SDL2.dll from oxygine-framework/libs
   to: oxygine-framework\examples\Demo\data\
- The working directory of the Demo project should point to the "../data" folder (right mouse-click on the "Demo" Project -> Properties -> "Configuration Properties" -> Debugging -> "Working Directory")
- ready! run!
=================================================================================================

3. You can generate your own Solution anywhere you want:
- You need Python 2.7 installed
- you need to run this script
  oxygine-framework\tools\gen_template.py

example:
	python gen_template.py MyProject -t win32 -d path/to/MyProject/
