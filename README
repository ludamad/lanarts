The project uses cmake to create plaform independent build files. 


Just run make_and_run.sh to build and run, or do the following:

To build, make a directory called lanarts_build, and do:
cmake <path to lanarts folder>

eg, from lanarts:
cd ..
mkdir lanarts_build
cd lanarts_build
cmake ../lanarts

Copy the exe from 'lanarts_build/src' into the 'lanarts' folder and run it from there.
